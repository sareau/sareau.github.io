So I've been getting into producing music recently, and it's been interesting but also soul crushing. There's something about the digital music creation process that does not fully interface with my brain properly. I just don't think my brain works in the way that other producers' work. Maybe its because I find it hard to develop music when I can only create one part of it at a time when in my brain, I can conceptualize the entire song that I want to produce.

As of late, I've been making some semi-ambient, droney stuff, and I've uploaded the demos to my works sections if you'd like to listen ([listen directly here](https://youtu.be/svjlc--gyvo)), but I'll be scrapping those while I try to compose a larger piece. Just recently, I think I was trying to achieve a sort of chill, almost classical atmosphere, something like "We Could Live Near the Beach" by Flatsound or some other piano-driven ambient track, but this past weekend I checked in on amaii's home video and listened to samlrc's set. I believe it included their *untitled* EP and some additional material, but it really captivated me. Its dark and brooding sound and thick instrumentation had me enraptured, and I now want to incorporates sounds like that in the music I produce in the future (though now it makes me want an actually good acoustic guitar because the one I have is terribly set up).

All that said, I still can't get my brain wrapped around Ableton Live. It confuses, befuddles, kerflungles me, even, but its stock plugins are just too good, and some Max for Live devices are just absolutely crazy. Despite its efforts to dissuade me, I will persevere (maybe, that or I'll die ʕ •ᴥ• ʔ), and I also just really like its visuals. It doesn't have some weird old UI in some of its plugins like Logic (and I hate the UI and UX of FL).

Oki, rant over!
