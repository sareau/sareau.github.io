This album or piece or whatever its classified as is just simply beautiful. The way Reich utilizes repitition and rhythm is hypnotic, and the atmosphere it creates transports you to some immaterial land. Listening to this is a meditative experience, and it conjured emotions within me that I had never experienced before. It felt calm, tense, and introspective and combined those things in a way that was wholly unique. It felt scenic, like seeing yourself fly past views of all your memories in a vast, open emptiness. It's just beautiful, and I can't recommend it more.
