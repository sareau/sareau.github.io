Three arrangements of "For Lovers" by Lamp. One for solo piano, one for piano and voice, and one for solo guitar. The arrangement for piano incorporates the vocal melody by doubling the right hand.

The guitar arrangement is based off of the solo piano arrangement; it includes things that aren't necessary, particularly when you are singing the song. If you are singing while playing the guitar arrangement, you can essentially play the first line, repeat the second line three times, and then play the last line. I also want to add that the chord shapes are weird and are generally more difficult than other tabs you might find.
