I live...

"Carved Heart" is an immensely beautiful and haunting song (and one of the more normal Natural Snow Buildings songs): really, its melody is enrapturing. So much so that I decided to make a transcription. Unfortunately, I am not blessed with perfect pitch nor is my ear training that good, so I had to rely on some tools to help me get my footing, but I think I've come to a fairly accurate result.

The tempo is fairly approximate; playing anywhere between 95 and 100 beats per minute is going to be reasonable close to the recording. Also, any parenthesized notes in the sheet music means that its not necessary to play those notes (because I couldn't quite tell if they were actually being played or not). Another also... the breath markings aren't that important, but the last breath is very noticeable in the song, so I included them anyway, especially since it seems the humming is continuous for about two measures at a time.

Here are links to the files and to the MuseScore page for my score:

If you would like individual part scores or something of the sort, feel free to contact me on social media. I also may make a piano version for this song.
