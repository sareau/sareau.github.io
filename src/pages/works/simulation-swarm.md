Here's a guitar tab that I engraved for the song. The tab is based on the most popular one on Ultimate Guitar by *chrlwhtng*, credits to them. I attempted to best reflect the structure of the song's actual recording. I also made some modifications to the tab during the instrumental bridge(?) and the outro to better match the song. (I still didn't transcribe the variations of the riff during those sections but that work isn't cut out for me.)
